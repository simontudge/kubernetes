# Kubernetes

Repo in which I learn to use kubernetes.

I'm following a course on udemy called Kubernetes for the absolute beginner. See `./kubernetes-for-absolute-beginner`. In here you will see summary notes, and all the examples that were done.

I also worked on some example applications of my own. See projects for these.
